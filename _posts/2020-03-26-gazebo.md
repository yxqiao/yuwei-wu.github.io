# Gazebo 

Gazebo has eight features that you can take advantage of:

    Dynamics Simulation: Model a robot's dynamics with a high-performance physics engine.
    Advanced 3D Graphics: Render your environment with high-fidelity graphics, including lighting, shadows, and textures.
    Sensors: Add sensors to your robot, generate data, and simulate noise.
    Plugins: Write a plugin to interact with your world, robot, or sensor.
    Model Database: Download a robot or environment from Gazebo library or build your own through their engine.
    Socket-Based Communication: Interact with Gazebo running on a remote server through socket-based communication.
    Cloud Simulation: Run Gazebo on a server and interact with it through a browser.
    Command Line Tools: Control your simulated environment through the command line tools.
