# 2. Kaggle learning week 2
* visualization
* exploratory data analysis(EDA) 
  * 1. getting domain knowledge (understand the data)
  * 2. check if the data is intuitive
  * 3. understand how the data is generated
* anonymized data
* verification
* data splitting(random, rowwise; timewise; by ID; combined)


* Q: common practice is to select one submission with a best validation score, and another submission which scored best on Public LB
* A:  this approach is based on the assumption that the test data may have a different target distribution compared to the train data. 
If that would be the true, the submission which was chosen based on Public LB, will perform better. 
If, otherwise, the above distributions will be similar, the submission which was chosen based on validation scores, will perform better.
